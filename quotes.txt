Deepen and increase your faith.
Act on your faith; make it a living witness to others.
Analyze and understand your fears; don’t be ruled by them.
Make Jesus Christ the only guide and the only goal of your life.
Turn away from material things; don’t be owned by them.
Train your mind to distinguish the true nature of good and evil.
Never let any failure or setback turn you away from God.
Face temptation guided by God, not by worry or excuses.
Always be ready for attacks from those who fear the Gospel and resent the good.
Always be prepared for temptation. And do what you can to avoid it.
Be alert to two special dangers: moral cowardice and personal pride.
Face your weaknesses and turn them into strengths.
Treat each battle as if it were your last.
A life of virtue has no room for vice; the little vices we tolerate become the most deadly.
Every important decision has alternatives; think them through clearly and honestly in the light of what’s right.
Never, ever give up or give in on any matter of moral substance.
Always have a plan of action. Battles are often won or lost before they begin.
Always think through, in advance, the consequences of your choices and actions.
Do nothing — in public or private — that the people you love would not hold in esteem.
Virtue is its own reward; it needs no applause.
Life is demanding and brief; make it count.
Admit and repent your wrongs, never lose hope, encourage your brothers, and then begin again.
